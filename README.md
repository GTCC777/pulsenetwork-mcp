# PulseNetwork MCP Server

**67 AI-powered intelligence verticals. One integration. Pay-per-query via x402 on Base.**

PulseNetwork is the most comprehensive x402-native intelligence network available. Add one block to your Claude Desktop config and your agent gains access to 67 domain-specific intelligence APIs — finance, legal, healthcare, immigration, real estate, crypto, careers, travel, sustainability, and more — all paying autonomously via USDC on Base.

No API keys. No subscriptions. Agents pay per query, $0.05–$0.20 each.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g mcp-pulsenetwork
```

Or use without installing:
```bash
npx mcp-pulsenetwork
```

### 2. Get a Base wallet with USDC

You need a wallet with USDC on Base mainnet. Options:
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com) — easiest, direct Base support
- [Rainbow Wallet](https://rainbow.me) — works great
- Any EVM wallet — bridge USDC to Base via [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)

Export your private key from the wallet settings.

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pulsenetwork": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-pulsenetwork"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY": "0xYourWalletPrivateKeyHere"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You now have 67 intelligence verticals available.

### 4. Add to Cursor / Windsurf / any MCP client

Same config pattern — point `command` at `npx` and pass your key via env.

## Example Usage

Once connected to Claude Desktop, just ask naturally:

> "What's the best path for an Indian software engineer on H-1B to get a green card?"

Claude will call `immigrationpulse` → `pathway` action automatically.

> "Compare ESG scores for Tesla, Exxon, and Apple"

Claude calls `esgpulse` → `benchmark` for each.

> "What's in season in the UK right now and find me a farmers market near London?"

Claude calls `harvestpulse` → `season` and `find`.

> "I have $40k in credit card debt across 4 cards. What's my best payoff strategy?"

Claude calls `debtpulse` → `payoff` with your details.

---

## Language Support

Every vertical supports the `lang` parameter. Ask Claude to respond in any language:

> "Explain digital nomad visa options for Brazil — respond in Portuguese"

Supported: `en es fr de zh hi ar pt ja ko it ru nl sv pl tr vi id th tl bn ur sw`

## The `discover` Tool

Not sure which vertical to use? Ask Claude:

Claude calls `discover` with `category: data` and returns the relevant options.

## For Developers / Agent Builders

This is infrastructure. Build agents on top:

- **Portfolio agent** — queries MacroPulse + FilingsPulse + AlphaPulse on a schedule
- **Compliance agent** — monitors CompliancePulse weekly, surfaces relevant rule changes
- **Relocation agent** — combines ImmigrationPulse + TransitPulse + RiskPulse + TaxPulse

Each agent builds on PulseNetwork as the intelligence layer, paying per query, running autonomously.
